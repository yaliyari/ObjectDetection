Object detection using YOLO3
The initial version is written on May 19, 2024. I gradually add more features to it

Notes:
If you use Pycharm, it would be easier to show images using cv2, so install opencv-python  (setting --> Project--> Interpreter)
IPython.dispaly would be easiter to be used in Jupyter Notebook, i.e., pip install ipython
